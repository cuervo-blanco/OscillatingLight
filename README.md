# Oscillating Light for Meditation

## Introduction
This project provides an Arduino-based solution for creating an oscillating light effect, intended to support meditation practices such as the OSHO Gourishankar Meditation. By emitting a light that fluctuates in intensity at a specific frequency, this tool aims to enhance the meditative experience, particularly during stages that involve visual focus.

## Purpose
The oscillating light generated by this Arduino sketch is designed to produce a throbbing effect with a frequency of 490 beats per minute (bpm). This frequency is significant in certain meditation practices, where synchronizing with a rhythmic visual or auditory stimulus is believed to deepen the meditative state. Specifically, for the OSHO Gourishankar Meditation's second stage, participants are encouraged to focus on a flickering light, which this project aims to simulate.

## Hardware Requirements
- An Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
- An LED light
- A suitable resistor (to prevent the LED from drawing too much current)
- Connecting wires
- A breadboard (optional, for easier connections)

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the LED to one of the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) capable digital pins on the Arduino (in the provided code, pin 3 is used).
2. Ensure to include a resistor in series with the LED to limit current and prevent damage to the LED.
3. Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB.

## Installation
1. Open the provided Arduino sketch in the Arduino IDE.
2. Verify and upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
3. Once uploaded, the LED should start to oscillate, creating a throbbing light effect.

## Usage
Place the oscillating light in your field of view during the meditation's second stage, where a flickering light is part of the practice. Adjust the distance and position of the light to ensure it is not too distracting or overwhelming.

## Safety Warning
**Important**: Individuals with a neurological disorder, such as epilepsy, should **not** use this oscillating light due to the risk of inducing seizures. Alternative methods, such as using a blindfold, are recommended for these individuals during the meditation practice.

## Note
This project is specifically tailored for use in meditation practices that involve a visual element, like the OSHO Gourishankar Meditation. It's essential to follow the meditation guidelines for a complete experience, acknowledging the meditation's structure and duration.

We hope this Arduino project enhances your meditation practice by providing a customizable and interactive element to your sessions. Please use it with mindfulness towards your health and well-being.
